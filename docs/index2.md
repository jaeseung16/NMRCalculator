## Description

The app shows the list of the isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin angular momentum. Select an isotope and calculate some basic parameters used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

For each isotope, the app displays the information relevant to NMR spectrosopy and the sections to calculate some basic parameters

### Information section
For a chosen isotope, this section displays the atomic symbol with the mass number, the nuclear spin angular momentum, the gyromagnetic ratio, and the natural abundance.

### Calculator section
A user can update one of the parameters in each subsection to recalculate the others.

- Larmor frequencies
  - The subsection displays the external field and the corresponding Larmor frequencies for the chosen isotope, the proton, and the free electron. 

- Time domain
  - The subsection displays the parameters used for signal acquisition, such as the number of data points, acquisition duration, and dwell time.

- Frequency domain
  - The subsection displays the paramters describing a NMR specturm, such as the number of data points, spectral width, and frequency resolution.

- Pulse 1
  - Ths subsection displays the parameters for a RF pulse, such as the pulse duration, flip angle, and RF amplitude in Hz and Î¼T.

- Pulse 2
  - The subsection displays the parameters for another RF pulse, such as the pulse duration, flip angle, RF amplitude in Hz, and the RF power relative to Pulse 1.

- Ernst angle
The subsection displays the parameters related to the Ernst angle, such as the Ernst angle and repetition time for a given relaxation time.
